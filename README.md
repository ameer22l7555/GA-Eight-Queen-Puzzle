# Genetic Algorithm for the Eight Queens Puzzle

## Introduction

This program implements a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to solve the classic Eight Queens puzzle. The goal is to place eight queens on an 8x8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.

## Genetic Algorithm Overview

A Genetic Algorithm is a search heuristic inspired by the process of natural selection. It works by evolving a population of candidate solutions (individuals) over generations to find an optimal or near-optimal solution.

### Key Components

1. **Representation:**
   - Each individual is represented as a list of 8 integers, where each integer represents the row position of a queen in the corresponding column. For example, `[2 4 6 8 3 1 7 5]` represents a solution where the queen in the first column is placed in row 2, the queen in the second column is placed in row 4, and so on.

2. **Population Generation:**
   - The initial population is generated by creating a specified number of random individuals. In this implementation, the population size is set to 4.

3. **Parent Selection:**
   - Roulette Wheel selection is used to choose parents for the next generation. Individuals with higher fitness scores have a higher probability of being selected.

4. **Crossover and Mutation:**
   - Crossover combines genetic material from two parents to create offspring. In this implementation, a random crossover point is chosen to exchange segments of the parent chromosomes.
   - Mutation introduces random changes to the offspring's genes. This helps to maintain diversity in the population and explore new solutions. The mutation rate is set to 0.1.

5. **Evaluation Function (Fitness):**
   - The fitness of an individual is determined by the number of non-attacking pairs of queens. The higher the fitness score, the better the solution. The maximum fitness score for a valid solution is 28.

## Implementation Details

### Code Structure

The code is structured as follows:

- `generate_individual()`: Creates a random individual.
- `fitness()`: Calculates the fitness score of an individual.
- `crossover()`: Performs crossover between two parents.
- `mutate()`: Introduces random mutations to an individual.
- Main loop: Iterates through generations, applying selection, crossover, and mutation to evolve the population.

### Parameters

- `population_size`: The number of individuals in the population (default: 4).
- `mutation_rate`: The probability of mutation (default: 0.1).
- `max_generations`: The maximum number of generations to run the algorithm (default: 1000).

## Usage

1. Run the program in Google Colab.
2. The algorithm will iterate until a solution is found or the maximum number of generations is reached.
3. The best fitness score for each generation will be printed.
4. If a solution is found, it will be displayed along with the generation number.

## Output

The program will output the following:

- Progress updates every 100 generations, showing the best fitness score achieved.
- A message indicating whether a solution was found or if the maximum number of generations was reached.
- If a solution is found, the solution will be printed, e.g., `[2 4 6 8 3 1 7 5]`.

## Visualization

The fitness progression over generations can be visualized by plotting the `best_fitness_list` using `matplotlib.pyplot`.
